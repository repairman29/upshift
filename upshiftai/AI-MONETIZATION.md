## 🔒 Technical Implementation

### API Key Authentication
```bash
# Required for AI features
export UPSHIFTAI_API_KEY=uai_pro_xxx
```

### Usage Tracking
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/track-usage`
- **Tracked**: JARVIS calls, smart suggestions, ML analysis
- **Not tracked**: Basic CLI usage (analyze, report, health)
- **Storage**: In-memory demo, database in production

### Quota Enforcement
- **Pre-call**: Check quota before expensive AI operations
- **Graceful degradation**: Fall back to basic features when quota exceeded
- **Clear messaging**: Upgrade prompts with pricing links

### Demo API Keys
```bash
# Free tier (10/month)
uai_free_user@example.com

# Pro tier (1,000/month)  
uai_pro_user@example.com

# Team tier (10,000/month)
uai_team_user@example.com

## 🤖 AI Features Gated

### JARVIS Skill (100% Gated)
- **analyze_dependencies()** - Conversational dependency analysis
- **dependency_health()** - Smart health assessment with explanations
- **Error message**: Clear upgrade path with pricing

### Smart Suggestions (Planned - Gate Later)
- **Context-aware recommendations** beyond static replacement map
- **ML-powered upgrade impact prediction**
- **Custom suggestions** based on project patterns

### Risk Assessment (Planned - Gate Later)  
- **ML vulnerability scoring** beyond basic age detection
- **Predictive analysis** of upgrade risks
- **Executive summaries** with business impact

## 📊 Usage Analytics 

### What Counts as AI Usage
1. **JARVIS skill calls** - Every conversational query
2. **Smart suggestions** - ML-generated recommendations  
3. **Risk scoring** - Predictive vulnerability analysis
4. **Impact analysis** - Upgrade risk assessment

### What's Always Free
1. **Basic CLI analysis** - Age detection, basic reports
2. **Static suggestions** - Built-in replacement map
3. **Manual operations** - Checkpoints, rollbacks, basic fixes
4. **Local processing** - No data leaves your machine for basic features

---

## 🎯 Business Impact

### Revenue Drivers
1. **JARVIS integration stickiness** - Once teams use conversational AI, hard to go back
2. **Team scaling** - 10+ developers = $19/mo becomes trivial
3. **Enterprise customization** - Custom ML models justify $99+/mo

### Competitive Moats
1. **Conversational interface** - Only dependency tool with AI chat
2. **Multi-ecosystem** - npm + pip + Go in one AI conversation  
3. **Predictive intelligence** - ML models vs static analysis

### Land & Expand
1. **Free adoption** - Complete CLI builds trust and adoption
2. **AI taste** - 10 free queries create "aha moment"
3. **Team expansion** - Individual success → team subscription
