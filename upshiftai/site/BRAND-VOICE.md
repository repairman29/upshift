# UpshiftAI Brand Voice

**Use this guide for every page and piece of copy on the site.** It keeps our message customer-centric, clear, and consistent.

---

## 1. Core principle: Customer-centric

**Lead with "you" and "your," not "we" or "UpshiftAI."**

- **Do:** "Find out what’s hiding in your dependency tree." / "Your dependencies, your machine—we never see your code."
- **Don’t:** "UpshiftAI finds ancient dependencies." (as the main hook) / "We analyze your project."

**Exception:** Use "we" when it builds trust or clarifies behavior: e.g. "We run locally," "We don’t send your dependency tree to our servers."

---

## 2. Tone

| Attribute | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|
| **Confident** | We know the problem and the solution. No hedging ("might," "could") unless it’s technically accurate. |
| **Helpful** | We’re on your side. We explain what you get and what to do next. |
| **Clear** | Short sentences. One idea per sentence when possible. No jargon without a one-line explanation. |
| **Respectful** | We assume you’re busy and smart. No hype, no fluff. |

---

## 3. Vocabulary

### Use

- **You / your** — "Your project," "your dependencies," "so you can ship with confidence."
- **Outcomes** — "Ship with confidence," "upgrade safely," "see what’s at risk," "get a strategy, not a list."
- **Plain language** — "Old or risky dependencies" instead of "ancient lineage" in body copy (tagline can stay punchy).
- **Action-oriented CTAs** — "Try it," "Get started," "See how it works," "Run your first scan."

### Avoid

- **Feature dumps without benefit** — Lead with what the user gets, then how (e.g. "Know what to upgrade first" → then "JARVIS gives you a strategy.")
- **Internal jargon as the first impression** — e.g. "HITL," "checkpoint," "apply fix" in hero; use in docs with a brief explanation.
- **Vague claims** — "Smart," "intelligent" only when tied to a concrete outcome (e.g. "prioritize by real risk, not just age").
- **"We" in hero or primary CTAs** — Prefer "Your dependencies, analyzed in seconds" over "We analyze your dependencies."

## 4. Page-by-page application

### Home (index)

- **Hero:** One clear promise for the visitor. Use "you/your" or a benefit. Example: "Know what’s old, what’s risky, and what to fix first—in one place."
- **Scanner:** "Your code" / "your dependencies." "Paste your package.json…" not "Paste a package.json…"
- **Value props:** Each card = one outcome for the user. "You get X so you can Y."
- **Footer:** One line that speaks to the user: e.g. "Your dependencies, your control. CLI is free forever."

### How it works (docs)

- **Intro:** What you can do (outcomes), then how (commands). "You can…" / "Run… to…"
- **Commands:** Describe what the user achieves; keep technical detail but frame with "so you can…" where it helps.
- **Config / webhooks:** "Your endpoint," "your project," "you decide when to require approval."

### Developers (dev)

- **Intro:** "Everything you need to run UpshiftAI in your workflow."
- **Install:** "Get running in under a minute." Steps framed as "you run…" or "run this to…"
- **CI / webhooks:** "Your pipeline," "your approval rules."

### Pricing

- **Intro:** "Choose the plan that fits how you work."
- **Tiers:** Lead with what the user gets: "You get…" or "Includes…" Focus on outcomes (e.g. "Run AI analysis on every PR").
- **Support:** "Need help? We’re here." Not "Contact us for support" only—add a short benefit.

### Blog

- **Titles and intros:** Speak to the reader’s question or pain. "When things break, who fixes them?" not "On the topic of failure handling."

## 5. Quick checklist before publishing

- [ ] Hero / first line uses "you/your" or a clear user outcome.
- [ ] No paragraph starts with "UpshiftAI" as the subject unless it’s trust/behavior ("We run locally").
- [ ] Every CTA is an action: "Try it," "Get started," "See how it works."
- [ ] Jargon (HITL, checkpoint, apply fix) is either avoided in hero or explained in one line where first used.
- [ ] Footer has one customer-centric line, not only product name + version.

**When in doubt:** Ask "What does the user get, and what do they do next?" Then say that in plain language, with "you" and "your."
