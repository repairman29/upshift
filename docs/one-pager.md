# Upshift One-Pager

## What is Upshift?

Upshift is a CLI that upgrades dependencies safely. It scans your repo, explains breaking changes, upgrades packages, runs tests, and rolls back if anything fails.

## Why it exists

Dependency upgrades are slow, risky, and disruptive. Most teams delay updates until issues pile up. Upshift makes upgrades predictable and repeatable.

## Core workflow

**Scan → Explain → Upgrade → Test → Rollback**

## Key benefits

- **Time saved:** Reduce upgrade work from hours to minutes
- **Lower risk:** Automatic rollback when tests fail
- **Clarity:** Breaking changes summarized in plain English
- **Consistency:** Same upgrade workflow across every repo

## Differentiation

- Dependabot tells you what to upgrade; Upshift performs the upgrade
- Copilot helps you if you ask; Upshift is purpose-built for upgrades

## Ideal users

- Indie developers shipping fast
- Teams with many repos
- Engineering leads managing upgrade debt
