# Enterprise

Enterprise plans include SSO, on-premise deployment, and SLA-backed support. This doc describes what’s available and how to get in touch.

---

## SSO (SAML / OIDC)

- **Single sign-on** for your organization so team members use your IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.).
- **SCIM** (optional) for provisioning and deprovisioning users from your directory.
- Contact us to enable SSO for your org.

---

## On-premise deployment

- Run Upshift (CLI + optional platform components) **inside your network** for air-gapped or compliance requirements.
- Includes: CLI, optional self-hosted audit/Radar endpoints, and (if applicable) AI/credits usage within your environment.
- Deployment options: Docker, Kubernetes, or VM images; we provide artifacts and runbooks.
- Contact us for licensing and deployment guide.

---

## SLA and support

- **SLA** — Uptime and response-time commitments for platform services (Radar Pro, API, GitHub App).
- **Dedicated support** — Priority support channel, named contact, and (for larger deals) professional services for rollout and migration.
- Contact us for SLA tiers and pricing.
