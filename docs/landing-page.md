# Upshift Landing Page Copy

## Hero

**Dependabot tells you what to upgrade. Upshift upgrades it and fixes the code.**

**Secondary CTA:** See how it works

## Trust Bar

- CLI-first workflow
- Works in your terminal
- Safe rollbacks
- Credits that never expire

## Problem

Dependency upgrades are the worst kind of work:
- Breaking changes hidden in long changelogs
- Migrations scattered across docs and blog posts
- Tests fail, rollbacks are manual
- Teams delay updates and accumulate risk

---

## Solution

Upshift turns upgrades into a repeatable workflow.

**Scan → Explain → Upgrade → Test → Rollback**

---

## How It Works

1) **Scan** for outdated or vulnerable dependencies  
2) **Explain** breaking changes and risk  
3) **Upgrade** the dependency  
4) **Run tests** and validate  
5) **Rollback** if anything fails
