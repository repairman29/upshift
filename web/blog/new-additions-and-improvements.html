    <h1>New Additions &amp; How We're Improving Upshift</h1>

    <p>We've been shipping a lot: new product features, a clearer site experience, and a focus on making the first run as smooth as possible. Here's a roundup of what's new and how we're thinking about improving Upshift.</p>

    <h2>What's New in the Product</h2>

    <h3>Radar Pro</h3>
    <p>You can now get a <strong>persisted view</strong> of dependency health across repos. Radar Pro (Pro and Team plans) stores your scan reports, gives you history and a dashboard, and lets you upload from the CLI or CI with <code>upshift scan --report out.json --upload</code>. Set optional <strong>alerts</strong> so we POST to your webhook when a report exceeds your thresholds (e.g. too many outdated or vulnerable packages).</p>

    <h3>GitHub App (beta)</h3>
    <p>Run Upshift on every pull request without handing over your repo token. Our <strong>GitHub App</strong> workflow lets you use an App installation token so scan-on-PR works for private repos too. Add the workflow from <code>.github/workflows/upshift-app-scan.yml</code>, set <code>APP_ID</code> and <code>APP_PRIVATE_KEY</code> secrets, and we'll comment on PRs with scan results and a link to Radar. A one-click installable App in the GitHub Marketplace is next.</p>

    <h3>Python, Ruby, and Go</h3>
    <p>Upshift isn't just Node anymore. We have <strong>full parity</strong> for Python (pip/poetry), Ruby (bundler), and Go modules: <code>upshift scan</code>, <code>upshift explain &lt;pkg&gt;</code> (including <code>--ai</code> and <code>--risk</code>), and <code>upshift upgrade &lt;pkg&gt;</code> with backup, test, and rollback. Batch upgrades with <code>upshift upgrade --all</code> work across these ecosystems too.</p>

    <h3>Migration Templates &amp; Plan</h3>
    <p><code>upshift plan</code> gives you an ordered upgrade list (dependency order + risk). <code>upshift migrate &lt;pkg&gt;</code> applies migration templates for React 18→19, Next.js 13→14, Vue 2→3, Angular, TypeScript, Jest, Vite, and more. You can add custom templates via <code>--template-file</code>. Community contributions are welcome—see <a href="https://github.com/repairman29/upshift/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>.</p>

    <h3>VS Code: Explain &amp; Fix in the Editor</h3>
    <p>Right-click in a .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx file and use <strong>Upshift: Explain dependency for current file</strong> or <strong>Upshift: Fix dependency for current file</strong>. We detect the package from your imports, run explain or fix, and show results in the Upshift output channel. For fix, you can apply edits in the editor or run in the terminal.</p>

    <h2>Improving the Site &amp; First Run</h2>

    <p>We want visitors to understand the product quickly and try it without friction. So we've been tightening the site and the get-started flow.</p>

    <h3>Product Hunt Launch</h3>
    <p>We launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/upshift-ai?launch=upshift-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a>. The homepage now has a clear call-out so PH visitors know we're live there. We also made the <strong>primary CTA</strong> "Get started free" and "Star on GitHub," with the email waitlist as a secondary option—so people can try the product or support us on GitHub without feeling like they're only signing up for a list.</p>

    <h3>Social &amp; Share Previews</h3>
    <p>When you share upshiftai.dev on Twitter, Slack, or Product Hunt, you get a proper card: we added <code>og:image</code> and Twitter card meta so the preview shows the right title, description, and image instead of a generic link.</p>

    <h3>Copy Buttons That Actually Feedback</h3>
    <p>Every copy button (install command on the homepage, and every code block on the <a href="/start">Get Started</a> page) now shows <strong>"Copied!"</strong> and a checkmark for about a second after you click. Small thing, but it makes the install flow feel responsive and confirms the action.</p>

    <h3>Demo Section: Smoother and More Obvious</h3>
    <p>The "See it in action" demo gallery now <strong>crossfades</strong> when you switch between Scan, AI Explain, Upgrade, Fix, and Full Workflow. The section <strong>reveals on scroll</strong> (fade-in + slight slide-up), and the trust bullets and Dependabot vs Upshift cards <strong>stagger in</strong> so the page feels composed instead of static. Demo cards have a subtle hover lift and scale so it's clear they're interactive.</p>

    <p>We're treating the homepage as a product-led growth surface: clear value prop, try-it CTAs, and a demo that shows the workflow without asking for a signup first.</p>

    <h2>What We're Doing Next</h2>

    <p>On the roadmap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>One-click GitHub App</strong> — Install from the Marketplace and get scan-on-PR and comments without copying workflow YAML.</li>
      <li><strong>Org credit pools</strong> — Team plan with shared credits and org-level policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Audit logs</strong> — Who ran which upgrade or fix, when; the CLI is ready to POST events once the platform endpoint is live.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We're also iterating on GIF quality and performance (sharper demos, optional hero video) and keeping the docs and CLI reference in sync with every release.</p>
