# Upshift Validation Drafts

Goal: validate demand for an AI-powered dependency upgrade tool.

## Core Value Proposition

Upshift is a CLI that scans dependencies, explains breaking changes, and generates migration code. It runs tests and can roll back if something breaks.

## One-Liner

"Dependabot tells you what to upgrade. Upshift upgrades it and fixes the code."

## Twitter/X Drafts

1) 
Building a CLI that upgrades dependencies with AI.

Scan -> explain breaking changes -> apply migration -> run tests -> rollback if needed.

Would you pay for this? If yes, what price range feels right?

2)
If a tool could upgrade React/Next/Node deps and apply migration fixes automatically, would you use it?

Reply with: 
1) Yes, I hate upgrading deps
2) Maybe, depends on price
3) No, I like doing it manually

3)
Thinking about a CLI: "Dependabot but it actually does the upgrade and fixes the code."

Would this save you real time? What stack should it support first?

## Reddit Drafts (r/programming, r/webdev, r/javascript, r/devops)

Title: Would you use a CLI that upgrades dependencies and applies migration code?

Body:
I am building a CLI that scans your dependencies, explains breaking changes, applies migration code, runs tests, and rolls back if anything fails.

In other words: "Dependabot but it actually does the upgrade and fixes the code."

If you would use this, what would you want it to support first?
- JavaScript (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Python (pip/poetry)
- Rust (cargo)

What price range would feel fair?

## Hacker News "Ask HN" Draft

Title: Ask HN: Would you pay for an AI tool that upgrades dependencies?

Body:
I am exploring a CLI that upgrades dependencies and applies migration code automatically (scan -> explain breaking changes -> apply fixes -> run tests -> rollback).

Would you use this? What stacks are the biggest pain? What price point would you pay?

## Discord Draft (short form)

Working on a CLI that upgrades deps and applies migration code automatically. 

Would you use it? Which stack should it support first?
1) JS (npm/yarn/pnpm)
2) Python (pip/poetry)
3) Rust (cargo)

## Validation Questions

1) How often do dependency upgrades break your code?
2) Would you trust an AI tool to apply migration code if tests pass?
3) What is the most painful dependency upgrade you have done in the last year?
4) What price would be a no-brainer for this?
